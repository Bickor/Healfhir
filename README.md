## Project Structure
There are two main frameworks in our application:

- Spring Boot: Utilized for the backend.
- React: Utilized for the frontend.

The project is then strucutred as following:
- [`frontend/`](frontend): Contains all the front-end code.
- [`src/`](src): Contains all the backend code.
- [`pom.xml`](pom.xml): Contains general information about the project, required dependencies and configurations to build the project.

## Running the Project

If you already have React, Spring-Boot, and Maven installed you can run the command:

```console
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

This should initialize the application on `https://localhost:8080`.
